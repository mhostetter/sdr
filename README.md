The `sdr` library is a Python 3 package for software-defined radio (SDR).

The goal of `sdr` is to provide tools to design, analyze, build, and test digital communication systems
in Python. The library relies on and is designed to be interoperable with NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
Performance is also very important. So, where possible, Numba is used to accelerate computationally-intensive
functions.

Additionally, the library aims to replicate relevant functionality from MATLAB's Communications and
DSP Toolboxes.

We are progressively adding functionality to the library. If there is something you'd like to see included
in `sdr`, please open an issue on GitHub.
