    Calculates the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on frequency of arrival (FOA) estimation.

    Arguments:
        snr: The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signal $\gamma = S / (N_0 B_n)$ in dB.
        time: The integration time $T$ in seconds.
        bandwidth: The signal bandwidth $B_s$ in Hz.
        rms_integration_time: The root-mean-square (RMS) integration time $T_{\text{rms}}$ in Hz. If `None`, the RMS
            integration time is calculated assuming a rectangular power envelope, $T_{\text{rms}} = T/\sqrt{12}$.
        noise_bandwidth: The noise bandwidth $B_n$ in Hz. If `None`, the noise bandwidth is assumed to be the
            signal bandwidth $B_s$. The noise bandwidth must be the same for both signals.

    Returns:
        The Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the frequency of arrival (FOA) estimation error standard
        deviation $\sigma_{\text{foa}}$ in Hz.

    See Also:
        sdr.rms_integration_time

    Notes:
        The Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the frequency of arrival (FOA) estimation error standard
        deviation $\sigma_{\text{foa}}$ is given by

        $$\sigma_{\text{foa}} = \frac{1}{\pi \sqrt{8} T_{\text{rms}}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{B_n T \gamma}}$$

        $$
        T_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac
        {\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (t - \mu_t)^2 \cdot \left| x(t - \mu_t) \right|^2 \, dt}
        {\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left| x(t - \mu_t) \right|^2 \, dt}
        }
        $$

        where $\gamma$ is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), $\left| x(t) \right|^2$ is the power envelope of the signal,
        and $\mu_t$ is the centroid of the power envelope.

        .. note::
            The constant terms from Stein's original equations were rearranged. The factor of 2 was removed from
            $\gamma$ and the factor of $2\pi$ was removed from $T_{\text{rms}}$ and incorporated into the CRLB
            equation.

        The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\gamma$ is improved by the coherent integration gain, which is the
        time-bandwidth product $B_n T$. The product $B_n T \gamma$ is the output SNR of the matched filter
        or correlator, which is equivalent to $E / N_0$.

        $$B_n T \gamma = B_n T \frac{S}{N_0 B_n} = \frac{S T}{N_0} = \frac{E}{N_0}$$

        .. warning::
            According to Stein, the CRLB equation only holds for output SNRs greater than 10 dB. This ensures there is
            sufficient SNR to correctly identify the time/frequency peak without high $P_{fa}$. Given the rearrangement
            of scaling factors, CRLB values with output SNRs less than 7 dB are set to NaN.

        The frequency measurement precision is inversely proportional to the integration time of the signal and the
        square root of the output SNR.
