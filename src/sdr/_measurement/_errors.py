class ErrorRate:
    r"""
    A class for measuring bit error rates (BER) or symbol error rates (SER).

        sdr.pack, sdr.unpack, sdr.hexdump

    .. _error-rate-example:

    Examples:
        Create a new bit error rate measurement object.

        .. ipython:: python

            ber = sdr.ErrorRate()
            x = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  # Reference bit vector

        Measure and accumulate bit errors from the first received bit vector containing 1 bit error at 10 dB SNR.
        The bit error rate of the first received bit vector is 0.2.

        .. ipython:: python

            x_hat = [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]; \
            ber.add(10, x, x_hat)

        Measure and accumulate bit errors from the second received bit vector containing 2 bit errors at 10 dB SNR.
        The bit error rate of the second received bit vector is 0.4.

        .. ipython:: python

            x_hat = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]; \
            ber.add(10, x, x_hat)

        The total errors are 3, total bits 10, and average bit error rate 0.3.

        .. ipython:: python

            ber.errors(10), ber.counts(10), ber.error_rate(10)

        Average bit error rates for every SNR can be obtained as follows.

        .. ipython:: python
